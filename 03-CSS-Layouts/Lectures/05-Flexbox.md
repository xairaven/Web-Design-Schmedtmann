## Flexbox

Flexbox is a set of related **CSS properties** for **building 1-dimensional layouts**.

The main idea behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container element
can be **automatically divided** by its child elements.

Flexbox makes it easy to automatically **align items to one another** inside a
parent container, both horizontally and vertically.

Flexbox solves common problems such as **vertical centering** and creating
**equal-height columns**.

Flexbox is perfect for **replacing floats**, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner
HTML and CSS code.

**Main property:** `display: flex`.

**Main Axis** is *horizontal* by default.

**Cross Axis** is *vertical* by default.

### Flex Container
- **gap**: `0` | `<length>`
    - To create space between items, without using margin

- **justify-content**: `flex-start` | `flex-end` | `center` |
`space-between` | `space-around` | `space-evenly`
    - To align items along main axis *(horizontally, by default)*

- **align-items**: `stretch` | `flex-start` | `flex-end` |
`center` | `baseline`
  - To align items along cross axis *(vertically, by default)*

- **flex-direction**: `row` | `row-reverse` | `column` |
`column-reverse`
  - To define which is the main axis

- **flex-wrap**: `nowrap` | `wrap` | `wrap-reverse`
  - To allow items to wrap into a new line if they are too large

- **align-content**: `stretch` | `flex-start` | `flex-end` |
`center` | `space-between` | `space-around`
  - Only applies when there are multiple lines (`flex-wrap: wrap`)


### Flex Items

- **align-self**: `auto` | `stretch` | `flex-start` | `flex-end` | `center` | `baseline`
  - To overwrite align-items for individual flex items

- **flex-grow**: `0` | `<integer>`
  - To allow an element to grow (0 means no, 1+ means yes)

- **flex-shrink**: `1` | `<integer>`
  - To allow an element to shrink (0 means no, 1+ means yes)

- **flex-basis**: `auto` | `<length>`
  - To define an itemâ€™s width, instead of the width property

- **flex**: `0` `1` `auto` | `<int> <int> <len>`
  - Recommended shorthand for flex-grow, -shrink, -basis.

- **order**: `0` | `<integer>`
  - Controls order of items. -1 makes item first, 1 makes it last
